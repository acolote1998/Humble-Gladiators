- Combat System:

  - Attack
    -> Performs an attack with the eqquiped weapon
  - Deffend
    -> If the enemy attacks the user while the user is defending, the user will only lose 50% of the HP that would initiall lose due to this attack
    -> If the enemy attacks thile the user is defending, block 50% of the damage. If the enemy does not attack while the user is defending, the user will also recover HP equal to it's constitution X its level
  - Focus
    -> Charges energy, pases turn, becomes focused. When attacking while focused = 50% extra chance of crit. When deffending while focused, either block 100% of the damage received, or recover hp equal to constitution X 2 X its level

  -Attribute modifiers:

  -> Luck : It affects the crit % chance
  -> Strenght: It affecks the attack value of the weapons modified by strength
  -> Dexterity: It affects the attack value of the weapons modified by dexterity
  -> Speed: The gladiator with the highest speed will act first in the combat

- Have to add "animations" during the battle resolution

- Make the battle actions log a text into the "battle log"

- Make the "waiting" functions a bit of random waiting times during the turns (to create dynamism effect)

-Maybe instead of a text saying "focused" we can have some sort of icon indicating it? (or not?)

-Characters seem to have a looot of hp when just created lv 1, update the formula so they start with lower hp?

- Implement Crit Hit System

-Implement the modification the "focused" state has when one is attacking (more dmg and more crit chance maybe?)

- Make a way to "find" and "start" the battles? (The "Find Oponent" button seems a very basic idea.)

- Maybe make a little "presentation" scene / animation before a battle will start? (maybe put both gladiators next to each other, with a similar 
BG image of the one the game scenario represents and so, and then kick off the battle by adding the overlays and so? maybe?)
