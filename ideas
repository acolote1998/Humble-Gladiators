- Combat System:

  - Attack
    -> Performs an attack with the eqquiped weapon
  - Deffend
    -> If the enemy attacks the user while the user is defending, the user will only lose 50% of the HP that would initiall lose due to this attack
    -> If the enemy attacks thile the user is defending, block 50% of the damage. If the enemy does not attack while the user is defending, the user will also recover HP equal to it's constitution X its level
  - Focus
    -> Charges energy, pases turn, becomes focused. When attacking while focused = 50% extra chance of crit. When deffending while focused, either block 100% of the damage received, or recover hp equal to constitution X 2 X its level

  -Attribute modifiers:

  -> Luck : It affects the crit % chance
  -> Strenght: It affecks the attack value of the weapons modified by strength
  -> Dexterity: It affects the attack value of the weapons modified by dexterity
  -> Speed: The gladiator with the highest speed will act first in the combat. Also, if two gladiators were to give each other the "final hit", the
  faster one will be declared the winner. In case that they both have the same speed, at the moment the hero wins by default

- Have to add "animations" during the battle resolution

- Make the battle actions log a text into the "battle log"

- Make the "waiting" functions a bit of random waiting times during the turns (to create dynamism effect)

- Make a way to "find" and "start" the battles? (The "Find Oponent" button seems a very basic idea.)

- Maybe make a little "presentation" scene / animation before a battle will start? (maybe put both gladiators next to each other, with a similar
  BG image of the one the game scenario represents and so, and then kick off the battle by adding the overlays and so? maybe?)

- Add unique DMG values for differnt type of weapons (variable weaponDmg in dealdamage() in the gladiators class)

- Make it playable online 1 vs 1?

- Make a SAVE and LOAD option -> - We should be able to load our gladiator and this should show his exact stats (probably save to a DB the gladiators ID + the object itself) - We should be able to see together with our gladiator his battle history (previously defeated oponents) and so on

- Make damages and so to be full numbers, no comas whatsoevver

- Make hero ID longer to minimize risk of saving the same hero into the DB?

- Make a "shortcut" to initiate battle? (skip login and so maybe?)

- Make a "podium" which will display the previously defeated enemies (for this we already need to have built the DB which will allow us to "save" and load our gladiators")

- Make that the initial dice change color once we have rolled them the first time (and they are not for free anymore)
